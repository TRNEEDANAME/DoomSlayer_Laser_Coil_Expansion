## Description

This is the github repository of the **mod project** folder for my [Doom slayer bridge mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2869237069). 
This will be the most up to date project folder from the mod, even before it's on steam.

## How to build the mod

### What you will need

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)
- Follow the wondeful [guide from the Xcom 2 modding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/firsttime#wiki_how_to_install_and_set_up_xcom_2_wotc_sdk)
- Start the SDK, go in file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).

  - PS : You will need [[WOTC] [WSR] Laser and Coil Arsenal Templates](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1831093105) if you use 5TWO for the weapon to have physics and actually be "usable"
- [Long war of the chosen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2683996590)
- Any other mod that adds Laser and Coil tech to the game (if you do, tell me about it so that I can add the code for it)

#### Supported mod

- This mod also add infiltration support for [[WOTC] Covert Infiltration](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567230730) (the slayer add +5h of infiltration and augment the risk, because he is the Doom Slayer).
- Support [[WotC] Coilguns - Beam Tier Replacer 3.0](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1929060959) and [[WotC] Laser Weapons - Magnetic Tier Replacer 3.1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1929061963). This support will require [[WOTC] WSR Weapon Skin Replacer - Core](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1517938486)
- Support for [WSR Shotgun Animations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1701209115). It cover the base, mag, laser, coil and beam shotgun and will require [[WOTC] WSR Weapon Skin Replacer - Core](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1517938486).
- Not really a mod, but this mod also changes the Beam damage to be more in line with the 5 tier's system. 

## FAQ

### Why not post the "ready to use" version of the mod ?
It's easier for me, but you can change the config without compiling the mod again.

### Can I do pull requests ?
**YES**, you can, you can open issues, pull request, discussions...

### Can I fork it ?
It's just config, but sure, just credit me.
